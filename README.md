# Valencian Streets Data Cleaning Project

![](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2020-11/Valencia.jpg)

As Spain's third largest city, Valencia is a Mediterranean city dating back to the 2nd century BC. With a rich history and culture, its architecture and street distribution is complex and heterogeneous. Due to its density (5865.1/km2), it's a challenge to ensure a smooth traffic flow and a safe environment for pedestrians. In this project, I will explore and clean a data set containing all streets from the city of Valencia, along with their features. A key component of the data set is the inclusion of the maximum speed of circulation for vehicles (in km/h) for each of the streets. 

The goal with this project is to modify and transcribe the available data, so that it is easier to process and use for data science applications, maintaining the principles of accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, validity, and uniqueness. The results and modifications are performed in this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/sguerraabril/Valencian-streets/blob/main/Calles%20Valencia%20Velocidad.ipynb).









## Installation

This project uses [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3. To install all necessary packages, run

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

which includes Jupyter, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
## Usage

The cleaned dataset is available in the project repository as [valencian_streets.csv](https://github.com/sguerraabril/Valencian-streets/blob/main/valencian_streets.csv). To use for further analysis or applications, cite 

```bash
